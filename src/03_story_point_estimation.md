Story Point Estimation Guide
====

Story points in Agile are a unit of measure for expressing the estimated effort required to implement a piece of work. 
This guide enhances the original scale with clearer definitions and examples, making it more adaptable for new teams.

## 1 Point - Very Minor Tasks
- **Description**: Trivial changes that require minimal effort and time.
- **Example**: Correcting typos, making minor text updates.
- **Timeframe (Approximate)**: Less than half a day.

## 2 Points - Minor Fixes
- **Description**: Simple issues that are well-understood and straightforward to resolve.
- **Example**: UI adjustments, basic bug fixes.
- **Timeframe**: Half a day to a day.

## 3 Points - Small Features
- **Description**: Small, well-defined tasks that are slightly more complex than minor fixes.
- **Example**: Adding a new simple button with a predefined action.
- **Timeframe**: 1-2 days.

## 5 Points - Moderate Features
- **Description**: Features of moderate complexity and size, requiring some research and effort.
- **Example**: Implementing a user profile editing feature.
- **Timeframe**: 2-4 days.

## 8 Points - Complex Features
- **Description**: Larger tasks that are well-defined but complex, or smaller tasks with some ambiguity.
- **Example for Well-Defined**: Developing an advanced search functionality.
- **Example for Ambiguous**: Adding a data export feature with unclear specifications.
- **Timeframe**: 4-6 days.

## 13 Points - Highly Complex or Large Features
- **Description**: Very large or complex tasks that are likely to have unknowns and require significant effort.
- **Example**: Building a comprehensive reporting system with multiple data sources.
- **Timeframe**: More than a week.

## Additional Guidelines for Effective Estimation

- **Team Calibration**: Regularly discuss and calibrate how story points are assigned to ensure consistency across the team.
- **Historical Comparison**: Use past completed tasks as a benchmark for estimating new tasks.
- **Break Down Large Tasks**: If a task seems too large or complex (e.g., over 13 points), break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Continuously review the estimation process and adapt the scale as needed based on team feedback and project evolution.
- **Avoid Direct Time Conversion**: Story points reflect complexity and effort, not just time. Avoid directly converting points to days or hours, as this can vary depending on the team member.
